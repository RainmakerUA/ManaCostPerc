This is an addon to customize the spell cost text in the spell tooltip. Allows to add mana cost percentage of total and current player mana. Aslo adds cost text coloring for spells using other power types (e.g. enegry, focus or runic power).

Example tooltip:

Mana: 180 18.1% 25.5%
This will rain down lots of icy stuff on
thine enemies to smithe them, in thy glory
```
